## The Problem
JavaScript is a programming language embedded in virtually all devices (computers, phones, and tablets) equipped with a browser. A data science toolkit in JavaScript enables usage without installation, provided the device is connected to the internet.

## The Approach
`tangent/ds` offers a user experience optimized for Observable or Jupyter notebooks. It draws from the best of scikit-learn (Python) and tidyverse (R) to offer a user-friendly interface for exploratory analysis through ordination and clustering, data preprocessing, classical statistics, and machine learning.

## Current Status
`tangent/ds` is equipped with automated tests that ensure compatibility with the best packages from R and Python. Although, like any software, responsibility lies with the user, its status is stable for production.
