## The Problem

Plant ionomics—the quantitative analysis of elemental composition in plant tissues—generates complex multivariate datasets requiring sophisticated statistical treatment. Manual analysis is time-consuming, error-prone, and often lacks consistency across studies. Researchers need automated, reproducible workflows that apply appropriate statistical methods and generate publication-ready outputs.

## The Approach

Ionomica is an automated computational workflow that processes raw ionomics data through a complete analytical pipeline:

- Data validation and quality control
- Multivariate statistical analysis (PCA, clustering, ANOVA)
- Elemental interaction networks
- Automated visualization generation
- Comprehensive statistical reporting

The workflow implements domain-specific best practices in ionomics analysis while maintaining flexibility for different experimental designs. Users input their data and receive a complete analysis package ready for interpretation or publication.

## Results

Professional-grade statistical analyses and publication-ready visualizations delivered automatically. Ensures consistency and reproducibility across ionomics studies while dramatically reducing analysis time from days to minutes.

## Tech Stack

R, Python, Tidyverse, ggplot2, statistical modeling packages
