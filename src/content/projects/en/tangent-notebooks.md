## The Problem

Traditional computational notebooks (Jupyter, etc.) require server infrastructure and complex dependency management. For JavaScript-based scientific computing and algorithmic development, there's a need for a simpler, more accessible approach that runs entirely in the browser with minimal setup.

## The Approach

Tangent Notebooks is a browser-based notebook environment that executes JavaScript locally using WebAssembly. It provides:

- Zero-installation computational environment
- Local execution (no server required)
- Familiar notebook interface
- Lightweight and fast
- Integration with modern JavaScript scientific computing libraries

Originally developed for algorithmic music composition (JMON-algo framework), the tool demonstrates broader potential for accessible scientific computing and interactive programming education.

## Current Status

MVP at 60% completion. Core functionality operational, with ongoing development of enhanced features and interface refinements.
