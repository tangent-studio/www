          Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          With a PhD in civil engineering, postdoctoral research in agriculture, and experience as a professor, I combine engineering precision with deep understanding of biological systems. My expertise spans numerical ecology, agricultural modeling, and hydrology, with applications in health sciences.

          Approach
        </h2>
        <p>
          "Living mathematics" represents the application of sophisticated quantitative methods—statistics, machine learning, physical modeling—to the dynamic, nonlinear systems characteristic of life sciences. This work bridges the precision of engineering with the complexity of ecological and agricultural realities, developing tools and workflows that respect both the mathematical rigor and the biological context.

          Services
        </h2>
        <p>
          As an independent consultant, I work with research institutions, agricultural organizations, and government agencies to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>Develop predictive models and decision support systems</li>
          <li>Create automated analytical workflows</li>
          <li>Build interactive scientific applications</li>
          <li>Provide statistical and machine learning expertise for agricultural and ecological research</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The focus is on delivering science-based, reproducible solutions that transform complex data into actionable insights.

          Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Good science requires good tools. Complex systems demand sophisticated analysis, but that analysis must remain accessible and interpretable. My work emphasizes automation not for its own sake, but to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and the ability to focus human expertise where it matters most—on interpretation and decision-making.
